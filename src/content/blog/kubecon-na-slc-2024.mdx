Welcome to Sign Language Tech! In this blog, I'm excited to share my unforgettable experience at the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america" target="_blank">Cloud-Native KubeCon North America SLC</a> event. The long 20-hour flight was pretty tiring, but that didn't reduce my eagerness to explore the expansive venue. The energy and ambiance were wonderful, and I was truly proud to present my very first 30-minute talk. This adventure offers endless chances to learn and engage around every corner.

Our adventures took us beyond the main venue to a beautiful spot within the city. The environment was refreshingly unique, with dry and slightly chilly air accented by a salty breeze. It felt like stepping into another world, providing a perfect backdrop for deepening our experiences even further.
